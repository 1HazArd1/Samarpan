# Instructions to follow while contributing to SAMARPAN
## Follow proper naming convention

1) Naming convention of the layout files: While creating a layout or a fragment file it should follow the following naming convention:
					  "type of user(user/NGO)" "__" "what is that page for" "_" "if fragment mention fragment"  
					   ```for eg user_login_fragment, ngo_dashboard```.

2) Naming convention of the kotlin files: All the files where the backbone of the application would be coded will have a similar naming 
				         convention as the layout
					 "type of user(user/NGO)" "what is that page for" "if fragment mention fragment"  
					  ```for eg userLoginFragment, ngoDashboard```

3) Defining views:The variable defining views or used for view binding should follow this convention:
                 "type of view" "page it belongs to" "Purpose of the view"  
		  ```for eg: btnUserSignUp```

4) Theme color: Theme color has been defined inside [colors.xml](https://github.com/Diversion2k22/Samarpan/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml) with proper naming    convention.  
  Use the theme color in the entire application according to the wireframe design provided above.

5) Defining Strings: All the elements inside the xml file under android:text="" should not be harcoded text. Define all the text inside strings.xml
		     with proper naming convention:
		     all the name inside a string elements should be like "type of view""what is the purpose of the view""which activty/fragment the view belongs to"  
         for eg: ```<string name="et_email_userLogin">Email</string>```
         
# Guidelines for raising a new issue
## Comment on any existing issue raised by maintainers or raise an issue

 All the issues should follow a set of rules 
  - Each issue should have an appropriate and short title like "Bug in user authentication"
  - Each issue should have appropriate tag associated with it.
  - Be specific with the changes you want to implement through the issue 
  - Whenever a participant raises an issue, by default it would be assigned to that participant due to obvious reasons.
  - Attach a screenshot/clip if applicable
# Contributing to the project

2) Create a new branch inside android studio before working on any changes
    the branch created should have the following convention. 
    "your name/username""related work"  
     for eg"xyzUserRegistration"
